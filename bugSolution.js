To solve this, identify the unsupported feature or incompatible module.  Replace it with an Expo-compatible alternative, or use conditional logic to check for its availability before attempting to use it. If a native module is needed, consider using Expo's managed workflow or ejecting to a bare React Native project for greater flexibility.  This might involve using `expo prebuild` or similar commands.
